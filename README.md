**Interviewer:** Harry Wu  
**Date:** Feb 1st 2026

### Stakeholder 1: J.C. (The Commuter)
**User Type:** Commuter / Buyer

**Goals and Needs**
1. **Cost Efficiency:** Needs to minimize textbook spending to prioritize essential commuting funds (LIRR tickets).
2. **Portability:** Requires digital materials to reduce physical burden while traveling with a gym bag and laptop.
3. **Location Specificity:** Needs transactions to occur strictly near the Washington Square campus to avoid additional travel to Brooklyn or other boroughs.
4. **Timeliness:** Needs to secure materials within the first two weeks of the semester to avoid academic anxiety and falling behind.

**Problems and Frustrations**
1. **Financial Trade-offs:** Forced to drop or swap elective classes solely due to prohibitive textbook costs ($200+).
2. **Physical Strain:** Carrying physical textbooks is physically unmanageable when combined with a commute and other daily gear.
3. **Scheduling Conflicts:** Unable to participate in traditional late night study groups at Bobst Library due to rigid train schedules back to Long Island.
4. **Access Code Barriers:** Frustrated by mandatory online homework codes which eliminate the possibility of buying used books or using free PDF alternatives.

### Stakeholder 2: A.Z. (The Seller/Lender)
**User Type:** Seller/Lender

**Goals and Needs**
1. **Anonymity:** Wants to interact and transact without revealing personal contact information, full legal name, or photos to strangers.
2. **Identity Verification:** Needs assurance that the other party is a verified NYU student to establish a baseline of trust without exchanging personal data.
3. **Secure Mediation:** Requires the platform to handle payments directly to avoid the risks of using P2P apps like Zelle with strangers.
4. **Safe Academic Engagement:** Desires an anonymous channel to ask questions in high level classes without fear of judgment from strict professors or peers.

**Problems and Frustrations**
1. **Marketplace Friction:** Wastes time dealing with bots and lowball offers on general platforms like Facebook Marketplace, leading to unsold inventory.
2. **Notification Fatigue:** Finds existing communication platforms overwhelming and distracting due to excessive, irrelevant pings.
3. **Social Anxiety in Class:** Feels uncomfortable admitting confusion in academic settings, fearing it will damage their reputation with professors.
4. **Lack of Recourse:** Fears lending items because there is currently no accountability or financial protection if a stranger damages or steals the item.
